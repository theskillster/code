# Day 5 - Python Loops

# Simple for list that will add a variable to each item in the loop
# Also conduct additional tasks within the for loop

# LESSON 16 - DAY 5 - AVERAGE HEIGHT

# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.
# e.g.
# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572
# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Example Input 1
# 156 178 165 171 187
# In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

# Example Output 1
# total height = 857
# number of students = 5
# average height = 171

# Input a Python list of student heights
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
  
# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
total_height = 0
count = 0
for height in student_heights:
   total_height += height
   count +=1 
average_height = round(total_height / count)
print (f"total height = {total_height}")
print (f"number of students = {count}")
print (f"average height = {average_height}")
