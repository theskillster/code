# Day 2
# Data Types
# Strings integers floats and booleans
# String

# use the number in brackets to return the char at that place in the string
print("Hello"[0])
print("Hello"[4])

print("123"+"345")  # This will concatenate the strings and not do any calculations

# Integer

print(123+345)
# 342_456_789 underscores act as commas

# Float

# 3141.89

# Boolean

# True
# False

# Check data type
num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
print(type(num_char))

# Changing data types

new_num_char = str(num_char)  # convert data type to str with str()
print("Your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")
# float() convert data type to float
# int() converts your data type to int - but you lose the places after the decimal, it doesn't round up/down - just shortens it.

# Mathematical operations in Python

# 3 + 5
# 7 - 4
# 3 * 2
# 6 / 3 # division always gives you a float type and 0.00  decimal place float.
# 2 ** 2 # to the power of x, exponents of

# Calculation is in the order of PEMDAS left to right
print ( 3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3) # 3 * 3 = 9 is first, then 3 / 3 = 1.0, then 9 + 1 = 10.0, and finaly 10 - 3 becomes 7.0.
# use the python IDE Thonny if you want to step through the execution process in more detail
print (3 * (3 + 3)/ 3 - 3) # This rearrangement using the brackets will allow this to equal 3.0
